Recommender systems python packages:

* surprise
* implicit
* LightFM
* pyspark.mlib.recommendation




Recommendation strategies:

1. Popularity (or other general metric). 
   * Can also be a "buy it again" recommender.

2. Content-based recommenders. Uses metadata as a guide.
   * This is rather difficult with our dataset.

3. Collaborative filtering.
   Predict based on user rating (or other indication from the user)
   and compares with other users.





Types of comparison for this dataset:

* User vs other users.
* Basket vs other baskets.
