Collaborative User Recommender systems:

These Recommender models compares a user's previous purchases against similar users
and uses that to create a recommendation.

"Users like you have also bought ..."

The "recommendation" matrix can be either boolean, i.e. "has bought" vs "haven't bought",
or we can use the number of orders that the user has placed of that product.
